## Exercise 1 ðŸŒ¶

### Question 1

Write a decorator ```time_exec``` that computes and print the execution time of a function.

You can test it on the function below:

```py
@time_exec
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result += i
    return result
```

### Question 2

Modify the previous decorator such that it also prints the name, the arguments and the result of the decorated function.

For example, decorating the previous ```factorial``` function will output:

```
factorial(6) -> 720 in 0.00001097s
```


### Question 3

Modify the previous decorator such that it can take an optional ```unit``` parameter. If ```unit``` is equal to "ms", then the execution time must be printed in milliseconds. Otherwise, it will be printed in seconds.

```py
@time_exec("ms")  # Will print execution time in ms
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result += i
    return result
```

## Exercise 2 ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶

In this exercise, we're going to 'mimick' Flask decorators in a very simplified way.

Create a class ```App``` such that the following code registers the decorated functions into
a ```route_dict``` dictionary.

For example, for this code:
```py
app = App()

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def index():
    return "Welcome"

@app.route("/new_user", methods=["POST"])
def user():
    print("Added user")

print(app.route_dict)
```

```app.route_dict``` will look like:

```py
{
   'GET': [{'/': 'index'}],
   'POST': [{'/': 'index'}, {'/new_user': 'user'}]
}
```
